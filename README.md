## Project structure

The project is structured in `components` and `pages`. Currently, only the index page is existing which contains all information about the CV.

In components, three main components are located. `RowEntry` is used for displaying a row in the table. `SectionTitle` provides the heading for a section containing one or more rows. And `SocialIcon` is used for displaying the social icons in the footer.
